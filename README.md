# PensionCalculator


This application contains an embedded database and tableView. ‘Participants’ can be added to the table (‘plan’). And then a calculation can be performed by selecting a specific ‘participant’. This application calculates the estimated Cash Balance plan pension benefit for
the selected person at their expected retirement date. All participants in the table will have their important data saved by the application, so that they can calculate their benefit at any time, or adjust their expected retirement year in the calculation to see different values. All data will be saved to the database, and will not be lost when the application is closed. This could be a useful tool for small businesses or Human Resource departments, to keep valuable data on employees and be able to calculate their employees estimated retirement benefit.
I included notes on how I performed the calculation in the About page of the application, if interested..
